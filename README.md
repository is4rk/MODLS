## 🧠 About
This repository begins as my Summer 2025 coding project.

The goal is to build a cross-platform tool that syncs selected folders across multiple devices—over a local Wi-Fi network—without relying on third-party cloud services.
The tool is designed to work seamlessly across multiple operating systems, including Linux (Arch) and iPadOS, allowing users to maintain folder parity across devices.

This repository begins as my SUMMER/2025 coding-project. The intention is to build a tool that lets you sink selected folders across multiple devices running multiple operating-system's, though a local wifi network.
The reason for me creating this tool is to have an easy solution for keeping al my notes synced between my laptop (Arch), desktop pc (Arch) and iPad (iPadOS).

## 🌍 Why I'm Building This
I created this tool to solve a personal problem:
I needed a simple and private way to sync my notes across three devices I use daily:

    💻 Laptop (Arch Linux)

    🖥️ Desktop PC (Arch Linux)

    📱 iPad (iPadOS)
I want to create a lightweight, local-only, and platform-flexible syncing tool.

## 🛠️ Key Goals
- Sync selected folders (one-way or two-way)
- Work over local Wi-Fi (no internet needed)
- Support multiple operating systems
- Minimal setup and dependencies
- No vendor lock-in or cloud storage
